# Replica set VS Deployment

## Introduction

This report provides an overview of the development and implementation of Replica Sets in Kubernetes. Replica Sets ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

## Overview of Replica Sets

This report provides an overview of the development and implementation of Replica Sets in Kubernetes. Replica Sets ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

### Replica Set

A Replica Set is a Kubernetes resource that maintains a stable set of replica pods running at any given time. It ensures that the desired number of pod replicas are up and running.

### Deployment

A Deployment is a higher-level Kubernetes resource that provides declarative updates to applications. While a Replica Set ensures a specified number of pods are running, a Deployment can manage Replica Sets and provides additional features such as rolling updates and rollbacks. Deployments are recommended for most use cases as they offer more control and flexibility over the application lifecycle.
